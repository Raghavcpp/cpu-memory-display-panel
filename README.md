# cpu-memory-display-panel
Just a simple display panel to see the real time usage of cpu processors and physical memory. Just put it in the startup folder and BOOM, its done.

It has a compact shape, drag-able, can be easily hide, restore and close. run on command prompt as its a python program (also make an exe but it runs slow in comparison, so you know ... if thing works then don't touch it)
